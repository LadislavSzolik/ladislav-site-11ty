                    <strong>Timeline.</strong> Jan 2019 - Jun 2020</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Problem statement.</strong> The mobile banking app for iOS an Android was a hybrid
                    application
                    with
                    low performance
                    and with few features. Because of that, the app had low rating in AppStore as well as PlayStore.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Goal.</strong> Reimagine and design a modern mobile banking experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Team.</strong> 4 native iOS developers, 3 native Android developers, a business analyst, a
                    scrum
                    master and a product
                    owner.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Roles played.</strong> I worked with 2 senior UX designers to research and design the
                    concept.
                    During
                    the
                    implementation I was integrated into the mobile development team. The team was based in ZÃ¼rich and
                    India.

        <h2 class="text-4xl sm:text-6xl font-semibold text-center mb-6 sm:mb-8">Getting started</h2>
        <h3 class="font-semibold">Challenges</h3>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside marker:text-slate-600">
            <li>The project had a large number of stakeholder with different interests.</li>
            <li>We had no clear idea about our target audience and their unmet needs.</li>
            <li>The new concept was constrained by the old backend</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="font-semibold mt-8">Proposed solutions</h3>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside marker:text-slate-600 space-y-2">
            <li>We invited stakeholders to a series of workshops where they shared and voted for ideas. Those ideas
                served
                as
                the first hypothesises about the app. Later, thanks to the workshops, we created a common vision.
            </li>
            <li>To clarify who is our primary audience, we interviewed stakeholders and customer facing colleagues.
                Also,
                we
                checked in the database which customers use mobile banking and what do they have in common. Lastly, we
                conducted
                two focus groups. Combining findings from all sources, we were able to define our target user and her
                most
                important goals:
                <ol class="ml-4 list-disc list-inside">
                    <li>Check how much money I have?</li>
                    <li>What were my latest transactions?</li>
                    <li>I need to pay this bill.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>We talked with engineers early to understand what data is available and what are possible changes they
                can
                make. Unfortunately, we needed to discard few ideas at the beginning due to technical limitations.

            The beginning was very chaotic, but we needed to accept this and trust the process. We learned to keep
            stakeholders in the loop, in exchange they were helping to push the concept further.

            <div class="space-y-2">
                <p>The version before the lunch of the new app was a hybrid application, it was a responsive website
                    packed
                    into an app. In certain scenarios this solution can work, however for a mobile banking app competing
                    with
                    many other apps it was not an option.</p>
                <p>This hybrid solution had many limitations. There was a delay once the user tapped on the screen.
                    Native
                    bottom navigation could not be used. More modern interaction pattern like swiping were not
                    fluent.</p>
                <p>When users wanted to check whether a transaction was made they needed to expand an accordion and go
                    to
                    another page and scroll. Once they navigated back, the whole site reloaded, making the application
                    feel
                    slow.</p>
                <p>Apart from performance and usability challenges, there was negative feedback on the branding. For the
                    users
                    the black and white was very sad and depressing.</p>

        <p class="max-w-2xl">We wanted to set an ambitious vision for the app, therefore we went far away from the
            current version. The visual language was moderner and brighter. The interactions were fluid, the information
            kept at minimum.</p>

        {% lessonsLearned %}
            This concept was made interactive by Origami Studio. It motivated the team and gave them the feeling of working on something great and exceptional. However, we needed adapt the design as the data was missing and the visual design was far from our current branding. Additionally, logos and profile pictures showed legal and technical concerns.

        <h2 class="text-4xl sm:text-6xl font-semibold text-center mb-6 sm:mb-8">Final design</h2>
        <div class="max-w-3xl space-y-2">
            <p>As a result of branding decision blue has become the main colour, and it was not allowed to use shadows
                or
                border radius. We accepted this constrains and use it to design the final version.</p>
            <p>The new home page is native, therefore we could use fluent swipe gestures to speed up user navigation.
                For
                example, the user can quickly scroll horizontally to check how much money she or he has on her or his
                accounts. Other example is swiping up the transactions list and continue scrolling. This pattern was
                borrowed
                from Apple and Google Maps.</p>
            <p>In summary, the top section of the home page answers the question: how much money I have? The middle
                section
                helps to find a transaction made or received. Finally, at the bottom we placed actions like pay and
                showing
                debit and credit cards.</p>
